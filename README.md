## About

The proposed project deals with the famous Mitnick attack which is based on the MITM concept and we have added the concept of CAM Overflow Attack which makes this entire attack an effective one. The backdoor file planting on the Mitnick attack is something we couldnâ€™t establish on our MAC systems and therefore we have supplemented the same with the CAM Overflow attack.



## Features



- CAM Overflow Attack
- Syn Flooding
- Three-way Handshake to establish remote access for Attacker to hijack the Victim
